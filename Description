WHAT IS GOING ON 
The system will function like a stream that we want to keep around the range of pressure of 10E-9 Torr to 10E-4 Torr. Because we need 10E-4 Torr, we need the turbo pump controller to function
My job is to automate the turbo pump controller using data given by the pressure transducer to ensure it stays within the range throughout
More power to the turbo pump equals less pressure in the system with more vacuum, vice versa for the opposite
